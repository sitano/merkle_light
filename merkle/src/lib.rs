//! light _Merkle Tree_ implementation.
//!
//! Merkle tree (MT) implemented as a full binary tree allocated as a vec
//! of statically sized hashes to give hashes more locality. MT specialized
//! to the extent of hashing algorithm and hash item, compatible to the
//! `std::hash::Hasher` and supports custom hash algorithms.
//! Implementation does not depend on any external crypto libraries,
//! and tries to be as performant, as possible.
//!
//! This tree implementation uses encoding scheme as in _Certificate Transparency_
//! [RFC 6962](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962):
//!
//! ```text
//! MTH({d(0)}) = ALG(0x00 || d(0)).
//! For n > 1, let k be the largest power of two smaller than n (i.e.,
//! k < n <= 2k).  The Merkle tree Hash of an n-element list D[n] is then
//! defined recursively as
//! MTH(D[n]) = ALG(0x01 || MTH(D[0:k]) || MTH(D[k:n])),
//! ```
//!
//! Link: [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree)
//!
//! # Implementation choices
//!
//! Main idea was that the whole code must obtain specialization at compile
//! time, hashes must be fixed size arrays known at compile time, hash algorithm
//! must be interface (lib should not dep on crypto libs) and lib must somehow
//! mimic std Rust api.
//!
//! Standard way in Rust is to hash objects with a `std::hash::Hasher`, and mainly
//! that is the reason behind the choice of the abstractions:
//!
//! `Object : Hashable<H> -> Hasher + Algorithm <- Merkle Tree`
//!
//! Custom [`merkle::hash::Hashable`] trait allows implementations differ
//! from [`std::collection`] related hashes, different implementations for
//! different hashing algorithms / schemas and conforms object-safety trait rules.
//!
//! [`Algorithm`] complements [`Hasher`] to be reusable and follows the idea
//! that the result hash is a mapping of the data stream.
//!
//! # Interface
//!
//! ```text
//! - build_tree (items) -> tree
//! - get_root -> hash
//! - gen_proof -> proof
//! - validate_proof (proof, leaf, root) -> bool
//! ```
