/// Compound Merkle Tree.
///
/// A compound merkle tree is a type of merkle tree in which every
/// non-leaf node is the hash of its child nodes.
///
/// This structure ties together multiple Merkle Trees and allows some
/// supported properties of the Merkle Trees across it.  The
/// significance of this class is that it allows an arbitrary number
/// of sub-trees to be constructed and proven against.
///
/// To show an example, this structure can be used to create a single
/// tree composed of 3 sub-trees, each that have branching factors /
/// arity of 4.  Graphically, this may look like this:
///
/// ```text
///                O
///       ________/|\_________
///      /         |          \
///     O          O           O
///  / / \ \    / / \ \     / / \ \
/// O O  O  O  O O  O  O   O O  O  O
/// ```
///
/// Once constructed, this tree structure has 12 leafs (addressable
/// from 0-11 for read or proof generation), which is otherwise not
/// coherently possible to construct with pow2 binary, quad trees, or
/// octrees.
